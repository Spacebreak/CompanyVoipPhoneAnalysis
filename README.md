# CompanyVoipPhoneAnalysis

This program is to analyze phone records provided by my current employers VoIP vendor. 
These records are provided in CSV format and each row in the CSV is an individual call record.

This program can break down the CSV file, analyze which dates these calls occur on and collate them together. 
This allows quick analysis for example how many calls occurred in June, which phoneline these calls were directed to and what the busiest day was.

As I am new to Python, I didn't implement proper OOP principles yet - I am currently refactoring the program.
